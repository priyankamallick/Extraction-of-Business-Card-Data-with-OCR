Extraction of Business Card Data with OCR!
In this particular project I have developed a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR.
The extracted information includes card holder name, website URL, designation, the company name, mobile number, email address, area, state, city, and pin code.
The database stores multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted information.
The extracted information then gets displayed in the application's graphical user interface (GUI).
In addition, the application also  allows the  users to save the extracted information into a database along with the uploaded business card image.
